# ActionKit

Welcome to ActionKit.

ActionKit is a general-purpose framework for expressing Actions. 

ActionKit is based on .Net Core, WebAssembly, and VueJS at it's core and aims to be as dependency-free as possible.

**Action** defined (1):
```iecst 
1a : A thing done, DEED
1b : The accomplishment of a thing usually over a period of time, in stages, or with The possibility of repetition
1c : *Actions* plural
1d : INITIATIVE, ENTERPRISE
2 : An act of will
```

## A thing done

Getting something done in a safe, predictable, and fault-tolerant way is **not** straightforward when it comes to systems at scale. ActionKit is an opinionated look at *one of the great **many** ways* to get things done.

ActionKit focuses on:

- Useability
- Visibility
- Scalability

### Useability

*ActionKit should be usable for developers of most experience levels* with an understanding that distributed Actions is an advanced concept and may require additional training to fully utilize in production environments.

ActionKit provides the following:

- [actionkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/actionkit) - NPM-distributed Javascript library to manage and invoke actions through a gateway.
- [ActionKit](../ActionKit/README.md) - .Net Standard Library
- [ActionGateway](README.md) - .Net Core Web Gateway reference implementation
